# Getting Started with Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications with server-side rendering, static site generation, and a host of other features out of the box.

## What is Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 is a Vue.js framework that provides a higher-level abstraction for building universal Vue applications. It simplifies common tasks like routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **Auto-imports**: Automatically import components and composables
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
- **Nitro Engine**: A new server engine for better performance

## Installation

To create a new Nuxt 3 project, run:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Nuxt 3 project structure:

```
my-nuxt-app/
├── app/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── components/
│   └── composables/
├── server/
├── public/
├── nuxt.config.ts
└── package.json
```

## Creating Pages

In Nuxt 3, pages are Vue components placed in the `app/pages` directory. The file name determines the route:

- `app/pages/index.vue` → `/`
- `app/pages/about.vue` → `/about`
- `app/pages/blog/[slug].vue` → `/blog/:slug`

## Data Fetching

Nuxt 3 provides several composable functions for data fetching:

```javascript
// Fetch data during server-side rendering
const { data } = await useAsyncData('key', () => $fetch('/api/data'))

// Fetch data on client-side only
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/data')
```

## Deployment

Nuxt 3 applications can be deployed in multiple ways:

- Static sites with `nuxt generate`
- Server-side rendered applications with `nuxt build`
- Serverless deployment with providers like Vercel or Netlify

## Conclusion

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework that simplifies Vue.js development with features like SSR, SSG, and auto-imports. It's an excellent choice for building modern web applications with Vue.js.
