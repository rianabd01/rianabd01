# Understanding Vue 3 Composition API

Vue 3 introduced the Composition API as an alternative to the Options API. While the Options API organizes code by options (data, methods, computed, etc.), the Composition API organizes code by logical concerns.

## What is the Composition API?

The Composition API is a set of additive, function-based APIs that allow flexible composition of component logic. It's inspired by React hooks but with some important differences that address common pain points in Vue 2.

## Benefits of the Composition API

- Better code organization and reusability
- Easier testing of logic
- Better TypeScript support
- More flexible component architecture

## When to Use Composition API

The Composition API works best for:

- Large components with complex logic
- Reusable logic across components
- Teams that prefer functional programming patterns

## Example Implementation

```javascript
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    const doubleCount = computed(() => count.value * 2)
    
    const increment = () => {
      count.value++
    }
    
    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component mounted!')
    })
    
    return {
      count,
      doubleCount,
      increment
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The Composition API is a powerful addition to Vue 3 that provides more flexibility in how we organize and reuse component logic. While it's not a replacement for the Options API, it offers an alternative approach that can lead to more maintainable code in complex applications.
